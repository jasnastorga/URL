# URL
URL shortener project

Developed in Python and Flask. Basic full-stack project to shorten long URL links. Had considered to deploy
using Heroku but ran into fews issues with App.js causing a blank screen. Does indeed route URLs and stores in Firebase DB
,therefore decided to have this be a local project. Did not include key for obvious reasons.
